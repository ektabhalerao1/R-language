Arithmetic with R
In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:

Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Exponentiation: ^
Modulo: %%

Type 2^5 in the editor to calculate 2 to the power 5.
Type 28 %% 6 to calculate 28 modulo 6.
Submit the answer and have a look at the R output in the console.
Note how the # symbol is used to add comments on the R code.

CODE->>
# An addition
5 + 5 

# A subtraction
5 - 5 

# A multiplication
3 * 5

 # A division
(5 + 5) / 2 

# Exponentiation
2^5

# Modulo
28%%6


Calculating total winnings
CODE 1->>
A_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
B_vector <- c(4, 5, 6)

# Take the sum of A_vector and B_vector
total_vector <- A_vector + B_vector
  
# Print out total_vector
total_vector

CODE 2->>
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Assign to total_daily how much you won/lost on each day
total_daily <- poker_vector+roulette_vector

CODE 3->>
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Total winnings with poker
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)

# Total winnings with roulette
total_roulette <-  sum(roulette_vector)

# Total winnings overall
total_week <- total_poker+total_roulette

# Print out total_week
total_week

Comparing total winnings

CODE->>

# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Calculate total gains for poker and roulette
total_poker <-sum(poker_vector)
total_roulette <-sum(roulette_vector)

# Check if you realized higher total gains in poker than in roulette
total_poker > total_roulette
